Answer: NTNUI Swimming group is open for everyone how is able to swim. That means that
you need to be able to swim at least 25meters in deep water without stopping. Our training
is divided in to three levels: Slow lanes are for those who never have trained swimming
before, but knows have to swim and want to improve this. Intermediate lanes are for those
who maybe know more than one swimming styles, and some of these swim the program that
the coach makes. Fast lanes are for those who have trained a lot of swimming before, and
know have to swim all the four swimming styles. Welcome!</li>

<li>Is it possible to try out the training before I become a member of the swimming group?

the license.</li>

<li>I have done all the steps under membership at the webpage. When can I start to train?
Answer: You have to wait for an email from the cashier that your name now is put on the list
in Pirbadet. Then you can pick up your entrance before 20.30 at Pirbadet. You have to wait
until we have started with the training for the semester before you can get your card. Pay
attention at our webpage, and subscribe at the email list to get information about this.</li>

<li>I want to be a member, and I have done all the six steps at the membership page on the
internet, but my name was still not on the list at Pirbadet. Why not?
Answer: After you have done all the six steps under membership, you need to wait for an
email from the cashier that tells you that your name now is on the list. This will take about
one week, but in the beginning of the semester it may take longer, because of many people
who are joining at the same time. So you have to wait for the email, and then you can go to
pick up your entrance card BEFORE 20.30 pm at Pirbadet.</li>

<li>I have paid the license, but my name was not on the list at Pirbadet. Why not?
Answer: It is really important that you have done the entire six step list under membership
at our webpage. And it is important that you have set your name on the payment. If a friend
has paid for you he has to write your name in the message on the payment. You may also
send an email to the cashier to tell who have paid for you. You also have to fill out the form
to let us now you are joining us correctly.</li>

again this fall?

pay the license until January 2012. But you still have to get a new entrance card at Pirbadet
