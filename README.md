# NTNUI Swimmings legacy web site

This is a stripped down version of what was NTNUI Swimming groups web site before. The exact oprational date is not clear but some database entries and images may suggest this project started roughly in the late 90s. This repository is heavily stripped down and might now work at all because of missing assets. Reason for stripping the repository is the lack of preservation of personal information and hardcoding of credentials.

Information that was stripped includes and is not limited to:
- personal identifiable information
- assets with questionable copyright owners
- external links
- usernames and passwords
- pictures
- external libraries

This web application was used for:
- news
- membership enrollment
- picture gallary
- swimming meet results
- membership database dumps
- personal storage space for maintainers

This project continues to live on in [this repository](https://github.com/NTNUI/swimming-website). Previous to that repository no version control was used.

If you notice any personal information in this repository pleas let us know at [sprint@ntnui.no](mailto:sprint@ntnui.no). Images have been sent to [NTNUI Blits](https://ntnui.no/blits/) for storage. Public images can be found at [NTNUIS mediearkiv](https://mediearkiv.ntnui.no/).
