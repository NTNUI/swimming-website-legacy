            <h2>How to Join the NTNUI Swimming Team</h2>
          </div>

          <p>Requirements not controlled by NTNUI demand that all
          members of the NTNUI swimming team hold a valid license with
          the Norwegian Swimming Association (NSF) in order to take
          part in our scheduled training activities. The situation is
          explained in more detail below.</p>

          <h3>How to Obtain a Valid License</h3>

          <p>There are two cases:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Swimmers registering during the autumn semester</b> 

              <p>An agreement between NTNUI, the Trondheim city
              administration and Pirbadet Foundation stipulates that
              new and existing members of the NTNUI swimming team make
              an advance payment, equal to the NSF license fee, to the
              swimming team's account. A bulk payment encompassing all
              accumulated amounts of the autumn semester is
              subsequently, at the start of next year, made to the
              NSF.</p>

              <p>Through this arrangement, you will not have a valid
              NSF license for the current year unless you already hold
              one. The only consequence of this is that you will not be
              allowed to enter any NSF approved competitions in the
              autum semester. You will, on the other hand, obtain a
              valid license for the entirety of next year.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Swimmers registering during the spring semester</b> 

              <p>You should make a payment equal to the NSF license fee
              to the swimming group's account. The money will be
              expeditiously forwarded by the board of the NTNUI
              swimming team to NSF's license and registration
              office.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>In either case, you will of course be allowed to take part
          in scheduled training activities from the moment your payment
          is registered on our account. The NSF license fee is
          currently NOK <b>330</b>, and this amount should be paid to
          the Swimming group's account <b>5361.06.92571</b> of
          "DNBnor". Electronic payments made through online banking are
          fully accepted. Please allow some days for transaction
          processing by the bank and ensure that your <b>name</b> is
          associated with the transaction.</p>

          <p>The means by which the payment is made are immaterial, but
          we would like to stress the benefits of having a written
          receipt of the transaction in case any trouble occurs. Such a
          receipt is most easily attained by using a "giro" which
          should be addressed to</p>

          <div class="c2">
            NTNUI Svømmegruppa<br>
             Stud. Post 222<br>
             No-7491 Gløshaugen<br>
          </div>

          <p>Additionally you should send an email to <a href=
          "mailto:redacted@redacted.com">REDACTED</a>
          containing:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Complete name</li>

            <li>Date of birth</li>

            <li>Address (including postal code)</li>

            <li>Telephone number</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We request that the subject of this email be "member". The
          above information is essential to member registration and the
          NSF, and no-one will be registered as a member prior to
          providing this information. We furthermore ask you to hold on
          to your receipt at least until your name is included in the
          member list at <a href=
          "medlemsliste.php">http://www.redacted-domain.com/svomming/html/medlemsliste.php</a>.</p>

          <p>Finally, once your name shows up in the member list, there
          is another administrative task you will have to perform.
          Pirbadet will provide you with a specially designed
          admittance chip. The chip is available at the counter at
          Pirbadet and you will have to pay a deposit of NOK 100. You
          should do this no later than 30 minutes before starting your
          first training session with the swimming team. You will also
          need a NOK 10 coin to lock the locker door each time you
          visit Pirbadet, but this coin is returned when you unlock the
          locker.</p>

          <h3>Email lists</h3>

          <p>If you want information from the group by mail&nbsp; you
          have to visit a <span class="c1">subscription page

          <h3>Why We Demand a Valid NSF License</h3>

          <p>In the summer of 2001 our previous training facilities at
          Sentralbadet were closed permanently and the swimming team's
          activities were moved to the, at the time, recently opened
          swimming pool at Pirbadet. The Pirbadet Foundation
          responsible for running the latter, together with local
          authorities financially sponsoring our training, maintain
          that only dedicated swimmers be allowed to participate in our
          scheduled training hours.</p>

          <p>By an, in our opinion, somewhat contrived definition, a
          "dedicated" swimmer holds a valid license with the NSF and
          this equates to all of our members having to hold such a
          license.</p>

          <p>On a final note: The swimming team rents training space in
          the main pool only. As a consequence, your membership in the
          swimming team does not permit you to use other facilities in
          Pirbadet during our training sessions. These facilities may
          be enjoyed during regular hours at Pirbadet but you will, of
          course, have to pay standard admission fees to do so.</p>
