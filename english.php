<h3>MEMBERSHIP</h3>

In order to become a member of NTNUIs swimming group, you must follow the instructions listed below. It is very important that you follow this easy recipe.
<br>
<b>1. Being able to swim</b><br>
There is no requirement as to how good you need to be or how fast you need to swim, as long you have the ability to swim on your own. Basic skills required. Experienced swimmers will be there to help you with tips and techniques if you feel the need for that, but no elementary beginners training will be given. We do not have the capacity to give this to anyone.
<br>
<b>2. Valid membership of NTNUI</b><br>
You have to be a member of the larger organization of NTNUI in order to participate in the swimming team. Membership of NTNUI is very cheap and youll get access to brilliant training facilities at Dragvoll and Gløshaugen. You can purchase membership at one of the two sports centers located at Gløshaugen and Dragvoll. More information: <a href="redacted-domain.com">REDACTED</a>
<br>
<b>3. Have a valid license from the Norwegian Swimming Association (Norges Svømmeforbund)</b><br>
All you have to do is pay the license of 450 NOK to this bank account: 5361.06.92571 (53610692571). NTNUI will make sure the license is paid.<br>
You may pay with following information from an international account:<br>
IBAN-number: NO60 5361 0692 571<br>
Banks name and address: DnB NOR Bank ASA, Stranden 21, 0021 Oslo<br>
BIC/SWIFT-address: DNBANOKK<br>
If someone else paid the fee for you, write your name as the payee. This is really important. We need YOUR name in order to give you access to the pool.
It is also possbile to pay cash at a bank or post office. If you pay at the fee at the post office or a local bank, the payment will take about 2 weeks before the transaction completes due to administration time. This is 2 weeks in addition to our registration time.

<h3>ACTIVITIES</h3>
<b>Trips to the NTNUI "koier":</b><br>
"Koiene" are cottages owned by NTNUI, and trips here are an important part of the swimming team. The swimming team goes on weekend trips to one of the cottages twice a year to enjoy beautiful nature, outdoor life (including skiing), tasty food and social fun. Some of the cottages also have saunas ready for us to enjoy. Youll never regret having participated on one of these trips!
<br><br>
<b>Students championships:</b><br>
Once a year, a competition is held by the different students sports teams in Norway where swimming teams from the student groups meet to compete against each other. One of the highlights is the beer relay, where NTNUI historically has shown that theyre unbeatable! Afterwards, there is a banquet filled with laughter, fun and dancing.
<br><br>
<b>Klubbkampen:</b><br>
Once a year, NTNUI meets the students from Oslo (OSI) to compete for a traveling trophy. We switch turns in arranging the swim meet. This competition is also followed by a banquet.
<br><br>
<b>NTNUI-Sprinten:</b><br>
NTNUI-Sprinten is a competition arranged entirely by NTNUI, and will take place for the first time on March 18th, 2007. <a href="index.php?side=sprinten.php">More information.</a>
<br><br>
<b>Social stuff:</b><br>
